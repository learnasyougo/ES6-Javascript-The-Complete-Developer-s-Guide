This is the tutorial you've been looking for to master ES6 Javascript.

Generators? We got it. Arrow Functions? Of course. Rest/Spread Operator? Included! And every other new piece of syntax!

Mastering ES6 syntax can get you a position in web development or help you build that personal project you've been dreaming of. It's a skill that will put you more in demand in the modern web development industry, especially with the release of modern web frameworks like React and Angular 2.

This course will get you up and running quickly, and teach you the core knowledge you need to deeply understand and build applications using each new piece of Javascript syntax introduced with ES6.

We'll start by mastering the fundamentals of iteration over Arrays using helpers like 'forEach', 'map', and 'reduce'.  After an introduction to Array helpers, we'll dive right in to advanced ES6, covering topics like enhanced object literals, default function arguments, and classes.  Every topic includes multiple live code exercises to ensure you understand each new concept.

If you are new to Javascript or ES6, or if you've been working to learn it but sometimes feel like you still don't quite 'get it', this is the Javascript course for you! To learn ES6 you have to understand it and comprehend exactly why each piece of syntax was added to the language
